In centralized version control system, users have the latest snapshot of the code. And whole history of code is saved in your centralized server.

On the other hand in distributed version control system, users have the whole history of code stored in their system. User can switch to any version without making any network call to code hosting server.

Apart from this there can only be one remote server in CVCS. While there can be multiple remotes in DVCS.
